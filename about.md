My name is Lakshya, and the easiest way to pronounce my name is to say 
"luck" with a "sh" sound at the end - "Luck-sh". The "ya" is silent and 
comes from the phonetic spelling of the Hindi word लक्ष्य (ल = La, क्ष्य = ksh, य = ya), 
which means your aim or goal in life.

I am originally from the New Delhi area and currently live in Chico, California. 
I love learning about how things work, and how to break and fix them. 
In my free time I enjoy developing open source tools and working on 
projects that make software development and testing easier. You can find 
my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/kapoorlakshya).
