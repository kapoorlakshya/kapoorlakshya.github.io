I am a graduate of California State University, Chico with a degree in
Computer Information Systems and a minor in Business Administration.
I have a background in Quality Assurance and Software Development.

I love learning about how things work, and how to break and fix them. 
In my free time, I enjoy developing open source tools and working on 
projects that make software development and testing easier. You can find 
my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/kapoorlakshya).
