I am a graduate of California State University, Chico with a degree in
Computer Information Systems and a minor in Business Administration.
I have a background in Quality Assurance and Software Development.

I love using open source tools and enjoy working on projects that
make software development and testing easier. You can find my
projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/kapoorlakshya).
